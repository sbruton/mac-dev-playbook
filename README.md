# Ansible Playbook for Rust-Focused Development on macOS

[![CI][badge-gh-actions]][link-gh-actions]

This repository contains an Ansible playbook and supporting scripts to configure macOS for software development. It is weighted towards [Rust] development targeting standard operating systems, WASM-based web development, mobile and embedded devices. This playbook borrows from the work done by Jeff Geerling and others in [geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook].
